3. Once identified, download the `Docker.dmg` file. 

4. Go to **Finder>Download** and double click on the `Docker.dmg` file, then drag and drop the **Docker** icon into the **Applications** folder.

2. Once you have downloaded the image, start  a new container by running `docker run -it almalinux:9 /bin/bash`. This will drop you into a bash shell inside the running container.

    You can check that you are using the correct OS by running `cat /etc/os-release` and verify that the output looks like this:
    ```
